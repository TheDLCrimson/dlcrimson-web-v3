## Overview

Understanding Linear Algebra can be challenging for students, requiring both theoretical knowledge and practical application.  

To address this, **AI-Book** was developed as an **AI-powered learning assistant** that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide contextual explanations and generate customized quizzes. It enhances learning and engagement by offering **interactive reading and dynamic practice exercises**.

**This product is ideal for:**  
- **Students** looking to improve their grasp of linear algebra concepts.  
- **Professors** seeking a tool to assist in teaching and testing students.  
- **Self-learners** who want an interactive way to study Linear Algebra.  

## Key Features

- **AI Chat:** Uses RAG to answer content-related questions directly from the book.  
- **Dynamic Practice Quizzes:** Automatically generates quizzes from book chapters.  
- **Future Expansion:** Plans to integrate multiple books into an AI-powered learning platform.  

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **AI Agent:** CozeAI with RAG and fine-tuning  
- **API Integration:** CozeAI API for AI-generated responses and quizzes  
- **Hosting:** Vercel  

Originally developed as a **private project between NaviAI and Professor Laurent El Ghaoui**, AI-Book was intended as a B2C educational tool. Although the deal was not finalized, part of the project is now open to the public, offering opportunities for further development and innovation.
