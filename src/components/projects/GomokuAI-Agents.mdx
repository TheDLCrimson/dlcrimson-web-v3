## Overview

This project explores AI strategies for **Gomoku**, implementing and evaluating **Reflex, Minimax, Q-Learning, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) agents**. The goal is to compare different approaches and enhance agent performance using **heuristic-based rollouts** and **hybrid search techniques**.

**This project is useful for:**  
- **AI researchers** studying game-playing AI.  
- **Developers** working on board game AI implementations.  
- **Gomoku enthusiasts** interested in AI strategies.  

## Key Features

- **Reflex Agent:** Uses heuristics to evaluate board states.  
- **Minimax (Alpha-Beta Pruning):** Implements adversarial search with pruning.  
- **Q-Learning Agent:** Applies reinforcement learning for adaptive play.  
- **MCTS Agent:** Simulates future moves for decision-making.  

## Tech Stack

- **Algorithms:** Minimax, Q-Learning, MCTS  
- **Optimization:** Alpha-Beta Pruning, Heuristic Rollouts  
- **Evaluation:** Self-play, human testing, bot matchups  

This project demonstrates how different AI techniques can be applied to **Gomoku strategy** and paves the way for **future enhancements**, such as **deep reinforcement learning and larger board sizes**.
